In these User Terms, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"ours\" refer to Trustpilot.\n\nThese User Terms are deemed to include all other operating rules, policies, and guidelines that are referred to herein or that we may otherwise publish on the Website (as such, rules, policies and guidelines may be amended from time to time), including without limitation:\n\n- Our \"Guidelines for the use of the Trustpilot Services\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"User Guidelines\"), which are located at [legal.trustpilot.com/for-reviewers/guidelines-for-reviewers](/for-reviewers/guidelines-for-reviewers)  \n- Our Privacy Policy, which is located at [legal.trustpilot.com/for-reviewers/end-user-privacy-terms](/for-reviewers/end-user-privacy-terms)   \n- Our Copyright Dispute Policy, which is located at [legal.trustpilot.com/for-everyone/copyright](/for-everyone/copyright)\n\nIn the event of any conflict between the terms contained herein and those of the User Guidelines, the User Guidelines will govern and control.\n\nBy using the Website, you accept to be subject to the User Terms, including the User Guidelines. If you do not accept these User Terms, you are not permitted to use the Website and are kindly requested not to use the Website any further. The registration as a user requires your express acceptance of these User Terms.\n\n## THE SERVICES ON THE WEBSITE\n\n#### 1.  Registered User\n__1.1__  Trustpilot grants you the non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited right to access and use the Website. In order to gain full access and use of the Website, you must create a profile and register as a user (hereinafter referred to as \"Registered User\").\n\n__1.2__  You are only permitted to register one profile per person on the Website. The profile is personal and you must not transfer it to others.\n\n__1.3__  In order to become a Registered User, you need a password. You choose your own password which must be used with your email address when logging onto the Website. Alternatively, we send the password to you. The password is personal and you must not transfer it or in other ways make it available to others. It is your responsibility to ensure that the password does not fall into the hands of a third party. If you become aware that the password is or may have been compromised, you are obligated to inform us hereof. We can and will change the password if there is a risk that the password has been compromised or is used in violation of the User Terms.\n\n__1.4__  During the registration process, you must choose a username. The username will be shown on the Website whenever you write or comment on reviews or produce user-generated content (see 2.1 below) on the Website. Therefore, you must consider whether you wish to use a username from which you can be identified by others. The username must not (i) be offensive or in other ways insulting, (ii) contain the terms \"Guest\", \"Admin\", \"*.dk\", \"*.com\", etc. or (iii) contain characteristics which belong to a third party, including names of famous persons, or personal names to which you do not own the rights. You warrant that your username does not infringe on any rights (including any intellectual property rights) belonging to any third party and/or pertaining to the User Terms.\n\n__1.5__  Changes to the username may only be made by us. If you want to change your username, please contact us at [support@trustpilot.com](mailto:support@trustpilot.com).\n\n__1.6__  We are entitled at any time, without notice and without prejudice, to delete, suspend or change your profile in the event of your violation or suspected violation of these User Terms or applicable law. When deleting your profile, you will no longer have access to services on the Website which require your registration and/or login as a Registered User. When deleting your profile, we reserve the right to delete the user-generated content (see 2.1) you have made on the Website.\n\n__1.7__  Furthermore, we reserve the right, at any time and without notice or explanation, to delete your profile and user-generated content (see 2.1). In this case, our disclaimer applies without limitations.\n\n__1.8__  You are not permitted to gain access or attempt to gain access to the parts of the Website requiring user registration if you are not a Registered User.\n\n#### 2.  User-Generated Content from Registered Users\n__2.1__  You hereby grant us the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free right and license to publish, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of and commercially exploit any material, information, notifications, reviews, articles or other types of communication (hereinafter referred to as the \"User-Generated Content\" or \"UGC\") which you create on the Website as a Registered User. We may freely use and transfer the UGC and disclose the UGC to third parties.\n\n__2.2__  Registered Users are liable for the UGC they publish on the Website.\n\n__2.3__  Registered Users warrant that all UGC posted on the Website is correct and true (where they state facts) or genuinely held (where they state opinions).\n\n__2.4__  UGC must relate to a company or organization from which the Registered User has purchased or can otherwise document using the company's or organization's products or services.\n\n__2.5__  You may not publish UGC regarding companies to which you have personal or professional relations.\n\n__2.6__  Registered Users must not, and must not allow any third party to, publish UGC on the website which:\n\n- is of a marketing nature or has marketing purposes,\n- is unlawful, deceptive, misleading, fraudulent, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, tortious, obscene, pornographic or profane,\nhas sexist, political or racial character,\nviolates other people's rights, including any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy and/or rights of publicity,\n- is offensive or in any way breaches any applicable local, national or international law or regulation,\n- violates these User Terms, including the User Guidelines,\nreveals any personal information about another individual, including another person's name, address, phone number, email address, credit card information or any other information that could be used to track, contact or impersonate that person,\n- has a disloyal or unlawful purpose and/or content (or promotes unlawful purposes), or\n- is technically harmful (including without limitation computer viruses, logic bombs, Trojan horses, worms, harmful components, corrupted data or other malicious software, harmful data or conduct).\n\n__2.7__  Contributors of UGC warrant in every context that the UGC is lawful and in compliance with the User Terms. If Trustpilot receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that UGC violates current legislation and/or the User Terms, we may delete the UGC without any notice, and we - dependent on the character of the violation - may inform the violated party and/or the authorities of the violation. Our right to delete will not be conditioned on an explanation, although we will strive to inform the Registered User about the deletion and the reason hereof.\n\n__2.8__  The Registered User hereby grants us the right to initiate and take any legal actions which we deem necessary in case of infringement of the Registered User's UGC.\n\nThe Registered User must guarantee to indemnify us for any claims which may be made against us as a consequence of the Registered User's violation of the User Terms or current legislation. The Registered User must indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim or loss due to third party claims against us resulting from the UGC of the Registered User.\n\n__2.9__  We may at any time request information about the UGC from the Registered User, including documentation supporting the information included in the UGC, e.g. documentation evidencing that the UGC is based on an actual buying experience in an actual customer relation to the company to which the UGC relates.  \n\n  \n  \n## GENERAL TERMS\n#### 3.

Limitation of liability\n__6.1__  WE SHALL IN NO CASE BE HELD LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR DAMAGES FOR THE USE OF THE WEBSITE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, INCLUDING (I) LOSS OF PROFITS, CONTRACTS, TURNOVER, BUSINESS, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR RECOVERY OF DATA, GOODWILL, SECURITY BREACH RESULTING FROM A FAILURE OF THIRD PARTY TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND/OR THE INTERNET, ANTICIPATED SAVINGS OR REVENUE (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY OF THESE ARE DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL) (II) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH LIABILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES (WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL) OR (III) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE WHATSOEVER. SOME STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n__6.2__  OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, MISREPRESENTATION (WHETHER TORTIOUS OR STATUTORY), TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USER TERMS, THE WEBSITE OR OUR SERVICES WILL NEVER FOR ANY AND ALL ACTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00).
