     We are a marketplace facilitator with respect to certain sales of Content by Models on the Websites. Where required by U.S. state law, we are assuming the rights and duties of a seller with respect to taxable sales of Content by Models through the Websites. Where required by U.S. law, we have registered with the applicable state departments of revenue and will collect and remit sales tax on taxable sales of Content by Models. We began complying with marketplace facilitator laws on or about October 1, 2019. We will deduct and withhold from any amount payable to the Model such as amounts as we are required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the provision of any applicable laws, and remit such deduction and withheld amount to the concerned tax authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the Model’s responsibility to remit all applicable Value-Added Tax or VAT, sales tax or other excise taxes to the applicable tax authorities to the extent any such tax payment is paid to the Model. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, Model hereby undertakes to hold us harmless and to indemnify us, our affiliates and our agents, from any claims made against us and them by third parties, including tax authorities, in regard of any VAT, sales tax or other excise taxes, or any withholding thereof, with respect to Model’s Content purchased by, or licensed to users. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Service, you agree and understand that you are solely responsible for the payment of all government, state, and local taxes, levies or any other similar fees.
    </p>
    <p>
     You will not receive monthly a statement showing any amounts you earned. However, you will be able to view amounts earned in your account. Payments are generally made within ten (10) business days after the end of each month (although, depending on the payment method used, it may take longer for you to actually receive your payment); provided, however, that payment will be made only when the minimum payout, based on net income, of one hundred dollars (US$100.00) has been reached. Any amount below one hundred dollars (US$100.00) will be carried over until the minimum payout has been reached and will be paid on the next following payment date. If you provide us with incorrect payment details, any fees for chargebacks resulting from such incorrect payment details will be offset against any amounts otherwise payable to you.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the event you violate any part of these Terms of Services, you violate any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right, or where a third party claims that all or any part of your Content caused it damage, we may, in our sole discretion, withhold indefinitely payments to you.
