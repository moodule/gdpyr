                    residents ("Consumer(s)") certain rights with respect to their personal information, as this term
                    is defined under the CCPA. In addition to the rights we state under this policy and subject to the
                    exceptions found under the CCPA, Consumers have the right to:
          <ol class="style-disc">
           <li>
            opt-out of the sale of their personal information, should we sell their personal information;

            appoint an agent to exercise their rights provided for by the CCPA, provided that a duly
                            executed notarized power of attorney is presented and provided that the agent has information
                            deemed sufficient to allow us to verify the identity of the Consumer in question and to
                            locate his/her information in our systems;
           </li>
           <li>
            Not be subjected to discrimination for the exercise of these rights. We will not deny
