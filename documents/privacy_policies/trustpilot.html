We only engage in this kind of data transfer where we believe it benefits you by providing you with a better experience, quality of service or to deliver content that you may be interested in.

This document helps you understand what personal data we collect about you, how we collect it, what we use it for, and what rights you have regarding your personal data.\n\nWhen we talk about “Trustpilot,” “we,” “us” or “our,” we mean Trustpilot, Inc., 245 5th Avenue, 4th floor, New York, NY 10016, USA. We also use “Policy” to refer to this Privacy Policy and “Website” to refer to our applications and all of Trustpilot’s websites through or in connection with which you are accessing this Policy.\n\n## 1.  Personal data - what we collect and what we use it for\n\n### 1.1  Master data\n\nWhen you create a profile or write your first review on the Website, we will automatically generate a personal account for you on Trustpilot (“Account”) and collect the following personal data about you (the “Master Data”):\n\n- Your username (this will be public),\n- Your securely encrypted password,\n- Your email address, and\n- Your location and country (your country will be public)\n\nThis information is mandatory, which means that it will not be possible to write a review on the Website without it.\n\nYou can choose to add further personal data to your profile. The additional data you can add is your name, a profile description, photo, gender, city and language. This additional information will be public.\n\nTrustpilot is an open review platform and when we display your review we will connect it to your profile so that people can see who wrote the review and the number of reviews you have written. Therefore, please be aware that depending on the information you add to your profile and the username you choose, you may or may not be anonymous.\n\n### 1.2  Information in reviews and ratings\n\nWhen you write a review about a company, we collect the information you put in your review. This includes:\n\n- Which company you review\n- The type of buying or service experience your review concerns (see the definition of “Service Experience” in our [User Guidelines](/for-reviewers/guidelines-for-reviewers))\n- The headline and content of your review\n- The location of your Service Experience\n- Your rating of your Service Experience with the company (1-5 stars)\n- Your rating of the Product (1-5 stars)\n- The date of your review and, if you update your review, the date on which it is edited\n- A reference number or order ID (if you or the company provides one)\n\nIf we ask you to provide information or documentation verifying your Service Experience and you send us such documentation, we will collect and process the documentation for the purpose(s) stated in the request.\n\nPlease don’t share any sensitive personal documents or information with us, either concerning yourself or others.\n\n### 1.3  Information about views, likes and how useful your review is for others\n\nWhen you write a review on our Website, people can show that they find your review useful, for example by “liking it”, and we collect this information. We also collect information about how many people read your review. We don’t track the identities of people who aren’t logged in and read the reviews, but we do collect data on the number of consumers who read your review. If you “like” another person’s review we will also collect that information.\n\n### 1.4  Notifications\n\nIf you notify us about a review that you believe violates our [User Guidelines](/for-reviewers/guidelines-for-reviewers), then we collect the information you provide in your notification to us. This can include which review you notified us about, the reason for your notification, the date of your notification, etc.\n\n### 1.5  Information from other services,  including social networks like Facebook\n\nYou can connect your Trustpilot profile with your profile on social networks, e.g. Facebook (“Social Network(s)”). When you use this option we automatically collect selected information about you from your Social Networks. The information we collect depends on what information you have made available on those Social Networks and your privacy settings for sharing such information on the Social Networks. Depending on your settings and selection, we will collect the following information from your Social Networks:\n\n- Name and/or username  \n- Email address  \n- Profile photo  \n- Who your social connections are\n\nWhen you make a request to connect your Trustpilot profile with a Social Network profile, you will be informed about which information we will collect from the Social Network in question. You will receive this information before your request is carried out.\n\nYou can choose to disconnect your Social Network profile from your Trustpilot profile via your Account. At this point, Trustpilot will remove your Social Network unique ID, and disconnect/revoke Trustpilot from your Social Network. Your profile picture from your Social Network profile will remain on your Trustpilot profile.\n\n### 1.6  Cookies\n\nOur Website uses cookies.

The IP address is the numerical address of the computer used to visit the Website. Browser settings can include the type of browser you use, browser language, and time zone. We collect this information so that we can trace the computer used in cases of misuse or unlawful actions in connection with visits to or use of the Website. We also use the IP address to approximate your location (at city level) and so that we know which sets of our [Terms \u0026 Conditions](/for-reviewers/end-user-terms-and-conditions) apply to your use of our Website.\n\n### 1.8  Newsletters and digest emails\n\nWhen you subscribe to receive our newsletters or similar emails we collect your email address and newsletter preferences.

However, please be aware that we may have the right to continue to process your information if it can be justified on one of the other legal bases mentioned above.\n\nYou have the right to object to how we process your personal data, or ask us to restrict the processing. Please see below, at 12, for more details.\n\nIf you would like more information about our legal basis for processing your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO) - see 14, below.\n\n## 2.  Disclosure of personal data\n\n### 2.1  Disclosure of personal data on the Website\n\nWe are an open review platform and we share your review on our Website so that others can read about your experience with a specific company. When you write a review, we will disclose your review, the number of reviews you have written, your username, your location (country) and other information you have chosen to connect with your public profile. Remember that if you have selected to use your name as your username, this can reveal your identity in full or in part - unless you use a pseudonym.\n\nWe recommend that you exercise care in deciding which information to make available for disclosing on the Website, and be aware that depending on the level of information provided, you may or may not be anonymous.\n\n__Master Data and other information__    \nWhen you write a review on our Website and create an Account, your username, review, location (country) , the number of reviews you have written and other additional information you have chosen to connect with your public profile will be visible on the Website. The companies you review can also receive information about your review.\n\n__Geo-location__  \nWhen you write a review on the Website, we use your computer’s IP address (see 1.7 of this Policy, above) to approximate your location to the nearest country. This information is made available to other users of the Website.\n\n__Reviews you found useful__    \nWhen you find other reviews useful (by “liking” them), other users of our Website can see the review(s) you “liked”.\n\n__Social Networks__  \nIf you connect to a Social Network, information such as your profile photo, your name, birth year and approximate location will be collected from your Social Network profile and used to identify you on the Website. Subject to your privacy settings and the level of information available from the Social Network, users of the Website can use this information to identify which reviews you have written.\n\nIf you have chosen to preserve anonymity by using a pseudonym for your Trustpilot username, be aware that information from Social Network(s) can reveal your identity in part or in full and make it possible to identify which reviews you have written.\n\nIf your contacts or friends (referred to as “Connections”) on the Social Network have also connected with Trustpilot, we display on the Website how you are connected to these Connections through the Social Network. This is only visible to you. Other people on Trustpilot cannot see your Connections from Social Networks.\n\n### 2.2  Disclosure on services to which you connect your profile\n\nIf you choose to connect your Trustpilot profile with your profile on a Social Network, information and reviews provided by you on the Website or data compiled by us about your use of the service on the Website (e.g. the number of reviews you have written) will be shared with and displayed in connection with your profile on the Social Network and will be subject to the privacy policy of the Social Network.\n\n### 2.3  Disclosure to other services, websites and companies\n\nOne of Trustpilot's main goals is to increase the exposure and availability of reviews on the Website. We therefore permit other services to show reviews created on the Website. This increases the potential audience for your reviews.\n\nThe categories of third party services and companies who can show your review(s) together with your public user profile are:\n\n- Search engines, including Google and Bing\n- Companies reviewed on Trustpilot\n- Companies that have invited you to review a Product\n- Consumer portals and business portals, including price comparison websites, shopping guides, etc.\n- Application partners and platforms, such as Prestashop, Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce  \n- Other similar websites where, in Trustpilot’s assessment, it will be relevant for users to search for reviews.\n- Facebook, if your review has been shared on the Social Network\n\nOnce you submit your review, it is published on the Website. This means that the following information is disclosed:\n\n- Your review(s), (see 1.2, above)\n- Your username, location (country) and the additional data you choose to add to your profile, such as your name, a profile description, photo, gender, city and language.\n\nIf you write a review on Trustpilot in response to an invitation sent by a company via our review invitation services, the company who sent you the invite will be able to link your review with the invitation. \n\nIf we need to verify your review, we will contact you and ask for documentation that shows that you have had a buying or service experience with the company you reviewed. We therefore recommend that you keep such documentation for 12 months from the date of your review. We explain the type of documentation you should send us [here](https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/201839083-Which-documents-help-us-verify-your-review-).\n\nWe do not share the documentation you send to us with the reviewed company. However, if you have a reference number or order ID, we may pass that on to the company, unless you ask us not to.\n\n### 2.4  Other disclosures\n\nIn addition to the above, we disclose your personal data to the following parties and in the following circumstances:\n\n- To allow third party vendors, consultants and other service providers to perform services on our behalf\n- To Trustpilot subsidiaries and other companies within the Trustpilot group of companies\n- To comply with laws or to respond to claims, legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas and court orders) and requests from public and government authorities\n- To cooperate with regulatory bodies and government authorities in connection with investigations or case referrals \n- To third parties in connection with enforcement of our [Terms \u0026 Conditions](/for-reviewers/end-user-terms-and-conditions) and [User Guidelines](/for-reviewers/guidelines-for-reviewers)\n- To third parties in order for us to protect our operations or those of our affiliates\n- To third parties to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property and/or that of our affiliates, you or others\n- To third parties in order for us to pursue available remedies, or limit damages that we may sustain\n- To third parties in order for us to investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and misuse of our Website\n- To a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, acquisition, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business or assets (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings)\n\n\n## 3.

We do not control the content of those third party websites, and assume no responsibility for the third party or their policies or practices.\n\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies for these third party websites because their procedures for collecting, handling and processing personal data will be different from ours.\n\n\n## 5.  Data processors\n\nWe use external companies to maintain the technical operation of the Website and our services. These companies are data processors for the personal data for which we are the data controller. By accepting this Policy, you agree that we may also allow the data for which you are the data controller to be processed by these data processors.\n\nWe have data processing agreements in place with the data processors and it follows from these agreements that they must act solely in accordance with our instructions. By accepting this Policy, you authorize us to instruct the data processors to process data in accordance with the Policy and for the purposes of using the Website.\n\nThe data processors have taken reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect against the information being accidentally or illegally destroyed, becoming lost or deteriorating, and to protect against the information being disclosed to unauthorized persons, being misused, or in other ways being processed in violation of data protection laws.\n\nOn your request – and possibly in return for remuneration at the data processors' applicable hourly rates at any time for such work – the data processors must supply you with sufficient information to demonstrate that the above-mentioned technical and organizational safety measures have been taken.\n\nThe Website is controlled and operated by us from the U.S. and is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country, or territory other than that of the U.S. If you access or use the Website from a location outside of the U.S., you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal data in the U.S.\n\n\n## 6.

We will delete this information upon your request and we will only save a log with the following information: your name, email address and the date of the deletion of your Account. We will keep the log for 3 years. All other information will be deleted.\n\nIn some cases, even if you delete your account, we then choose to retain certain information (e.g. visits to our Website) in an anonymized or aggregated form.\n\n\n## 7.  Security measures\n\nWe use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect your personal data within our organization and we regularly audit our system for vulnerabilities. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the information you transmit to us. Emails sent via the Website may not be encrypted, and we therefore advise you not to include any confidential information in your emails to us.\n\nTo learn more about our current practices and policies regarding security and other information, please see [our security practices](https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000721308--Our-security-practices).

Your California Privacy rights\n\nThis section provides additional details about the personal information we collect about California consumers and the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).\n\nFor more details about the personal information we have collected over the last 12 months, please see the information in Sections 1.1 – 1.8 above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in Section 1.9 above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in Section 2 above.\n\nUnder the CCPA you have the following rights in relation to the personal information that we hold about you:\n\n- right to be informed\n- right to request deletion\n- right to opt-out\n- right to disclosure\n- right to equal services and prices (non-discrimination)\n\nWe are committed to exercising your privacy rights, including the rights granted to you under the CCPA.\n\nIn accordance with the CCPA’s requirements, we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

We will verify your request using the information associated with your account, including email address. Californian consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf.\n\nYou may request to opt out of sale of your personal information to third parties. The CCPA defines a sale very broadly and this includes communicating personal information to another business or a third party for non-financial gain. Trustpilot will never sell your data for profit, however, where we transfer it to our partners for things like displaying personalised ads to you or to deliver improvements to our service, these uses fall within the broad definition of a “sale” under CCPA. We only engage in this kind of data transfer where we believe it benefits you by providing you with a better experience, quality of service or to deliver content that you may be interested in.\n\nYou can opt out from any practice that may lead to sale of your personal data at any time. To manage your privacy preferences and opt out of the sale of your personal information, please use the features provided to opt out here: [https://www.trustpilot.com/do-not-sell-my-info](https://www.trustpilot.com/do-not-sell-my-info).

This document helps you understand what personal data we collect about you, how we collect it, what we use it for, and what rights you have regarding your personal data.\n\nWhen we talk about “Trustpilot,” “we,” “us” or “our,” we mean Trustpilot, Inc., 245 5th Avenue, 4th floor, New York, NY 10016, USA. We also use “Policy” to refer to this Privacy Policy and “Website” to refer to our applications and all of Trustpilot’s websites through or in connection with which you are accessing this Policy.\n\n## 1.  Personal data - what we collect and what we use it for\n\n### 1.1  Master data\n\nWhen you create a profile or write your first review on the Website, we will automatically generate a personal account for you on Trustpilot (“Account”) and collect the following personal data about you (the “Master Data”):\n\n- Your username (this will be public),\n- Your securely encrypted password,\n- Your email address, and\n- Your location and country (your country will be public)\n\nThis information is mandatory, which means that it will not be possible to write a review on the Website without it.\n\nYou can choose to add further personal data to your profile. The additional data you can add is your name, a profile description, photo, gender, city and language. This additional information will be public.\n\nTrustpilot is an open review platform and when we display your review we will connect it to your profile so that people can see who wrote the review and the number of reviews you have written. Therefore, please be aware that depending on the information you add to your profile and the username you choose, you may or may not be anonymous.\n\n### 1.2  Information in reviews and ratings\n\nWhen you write a review about a company, we collect the information you put in your review. This includes:\n\n- Which company you review\n- The type of buying or service experience your review concerns (see the definition of “Service Experience” in our [User Guidelines](/for-reviewers/guidelines-for-reviewers))\n- The headline and content of your review\n- The location of your Service Experience\n- Your rating of your Service Experience with the company (1-5 stars)\n- Your rating of the Product (1-5 stars)\n- The date of your review and, if you update your review, the date on which it is edited\n- A reference number or order ID (if you or the company provides one)\n\nIf we ask you to provide information or documentation verifying your Service Experience and you send us such documentation, we will collect and process the documentation for the purpose(s) stated in the request.\n\nPlease don’t share any sensitive personal documents or information with us, either concerning yourself or others.\n\n### 1.3  Information about views, likes and how useful your review is for others\n\nWhen you write a review on our Website, people can show that they find your review useful, for example by “liking it”, and we collect this information. We also collect information about how many people read your review. We don’t track the identities of people who aren’t logged in and read the reviews, but we do collect data on the number of consumers who read your review. If you “like” another person’s review we will also collect that information.\n\n### 1.4  Notifications\n\nIf you notify us about a review that you believe violates our [User Guidelines](/for-reviewers/guidelines-for-reviewers), then we collect the information you provide in your notification to us. This can include which review you notified us about, the reason for your notification, the date of your notification, etc.\n\n### 1.5  Information from other services,  including social networks like Facebook\n\nYou can connect your Trustpilot profile with your profile on social networks, e.g. Facebook (“Social Network(s)”). When you use this option we automatically collect selected information about you from your Social Networks. The information we collect depends on what information you have made available on those Social Networks and your privacy settings for sharing such information on the Social Networks. Depending on your settings and selection, we will collect the following information from your Social Networks:\n\n- Name and/or username  \n- Email address  \n- Profile photo  \n- Who your social connections are\n\nWhen you make a request to connect your Trustpilot profile with a Social Network profile, you will be informed about which information we will collect from the Social Network in question. You will receive this information before your request is carried out.\n\nYou can choose to disconnect your Social Network profile from your Trustpilot profile via your Account. At this point, Trustpilot will remove your Social Network unique ID, and disconnect/revoke Trustpilot from your Social Network. Your profile picture from your Social Network profile will remain on your Trustpilot profile.\n\n### 1.6  Cookies\n\nOur Website uses cookies. Cookies identify your computer or device rather than you as an individual user, and are used for different purposes.\n\nRead more about which cookies the Website uses and for which purposes below (in 8).\n\n### 1.7  Your IP address, browser settings and location\n\nWhen you visit the Website, we register your computer’s IP address and browser settings. The IP address is the numerical address of the computer used to visit the Website. Browser settings can include the type of browser you use, browser language, and time zone. We collect this information so that we can trace the computer used in cases of misuse or unlawful actions in connection with visits to or use of the Website. We also use the IP address to approximate your location (at city level) and so that we know which sets of our [Terms \u0026 Conditions](/for-reviewers/end-user-terms-and-conditions) apply to your use of our Website.\n\n### 1.8  Newsletters and digest emails\n\nWhen you subscribe to receive our newsletters or similar emails we collect your email address and newsletter preferences. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters or similar emails, you can unsubscribe by logging into your Account and changing your email settings or you can contact us at [privacy@trustpilot.com](mailto:privacy@trustpilot.com).\n\n### 1.9  For what purposes do we use your personal data?\n\nWe will use the information you provide to us to:\n\n- Provide our services to you, including displaying your reviews, and providing you with access to your profile and our Website  \n- Identify you as a registered user when you log in to the Website and re-visit the Website  \n- Verify the legitimacy of your reviews  \n- Improve the Website and our services  \n- Invite you to leave more reviews  \n- Respond to your questions and provide related customer service  \n- Pass on a message from the company you reviewed or the company that has invited you to review a Service Experience or a Product via the Website  \n- Contact you if your review is flagged by other users or companies and, if necessary, ask you to provide documentation to verify your review or experience  \n- Send you our newsletters  \n- Inform you when other users find your review helpful or otherwise provide feedback concerning your review  \n- Facilitate the social sharing function, including giving you the option to connect with members of your network who are both users of Trustpilot and users of one or more Social Networks  \n- Display which members of your Social Networks are users of Trustpilot in order to increase confidence in reviews and to create a better user experience on our Website  \n- Engage in various internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products and services, improving or modifying the Website, or our services including our TrustBoxes, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities\n- Comply with legal requirements and legal process, requests from public and governmental authorities, relevant industry standards and our internal policies  \n- Enforce our [Terms \u0026 Conditions](/for-reviewers/end-user-terms-and-conditions)  \n- Protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates  \n- Protect our rights, privacy, safety or property and/or that of our affiliates, you or others  \n- Allow us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we sustain\n\nWe will also use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.\n\n### 1.10  On what legal basis do we process your personal data?\n\nWe need to process your personal data in order to:\n\n- Perform our contract with you.  \n- Comply with our legal obligations and operate an online review platform in compliance with applicable legal acts.  \n- Pursue legitimate business interests of our own related to operating the Website and providing our services to you, or to pursue the legitimate interests of third parties as long as your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.  \n- For the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, where necessary.\n\nSome of these grounds for processing your personal data overlap, so there may be several reasons which justify us processing your personal data.\n\nIn those limited circumstances where you have expressly given your consent to us to process your personal data, for example, when subscribing to our newsletters, you are free to revoke your consent at any time. However, please be aware that we may have the right to continue to process your information if it can be justified on one of the other legal bases mentioned above.\n\nYou have the right to object to how we process your personal data, or ask us to restrict the processing. Please see below, at 12, for more details.\n\nIf you would like more information about our legal basis for processing your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO) - see 14, below.\n\n## 2.  Disclosure of personal data\n\n### 2.1  Disclosure of personal data on the Website\n\nWe are an open review platform and we share your review on our Website so that others can read about your experience with a specific company. When you write a review, we will disclose your review, the number of reviews you have written, your username, your location (country) and other information you have chosen to connect with your public profile. Remember that if you have selected to use your name as your username, this can reveal your identity in full or in part - unless you use a pseudonym.\n\nWe recommend that you exercise care in deciding which information to make available for disclosing on the Website, and be aware that depending on the level of information provided, you may or may not be anonymous.\n\n__Master Data and other information__    \nWhen you write a review on our Website and create an Account, your username, review, location (country) , the number of reviews you have written and other additional information you have chosen to connect with your public profile will be visible on the Website. The companies you review can also receive information about your review.\n\n__Geo-location__  \nWhen you write a review on the Website, we use your computer’s IP address (see 1.7 of this Policy, above) to approximate your location to the nearest country. This information is made available to other users of the Website.\n\n__Reviews you found useful__    \nWhen you find other reviews useful (by “liking” them), other users of our Website can see the review(s) you “liked”.\n\n__Social Networks__  \nIf you connect to a Social Network, information such as your profile photo, your name, birth year and approximate location will be collected from your Social Network profile and used to identify you on the Website. Subject to your privacy settings and the level of information available from the Social Network, users of the Website can use this information to identify which reviews you have written.\n\nIf you have chosen to preserve anonymity by using a pseudonym for your Trustpilot username, be aware that information from Social Network(s) can reveal your identity in part or in full and make it possible to identify which reviews you have written.\n\nIf your contacts or friends (referred to as “Connections”) on the Social Network have also connected with Trustpilot, we display on the Website how you are connected to these Connections through the Social Network. This is only visible to you. Other people on Trustpilot cannot see your Connections from Social Networks.\n\n### 2.2  Disclosure on services to which you connect your profile\n\nIf you choose to connect your Trustpilot profile with your profile on a Social Network, information and reviews provided by you on the Website or data compiled by us about your use of the service on the Website (e.g. the number of reviews you have written) will be shared with and displayed in connection with your profile on the Social Network and will be subject to the privacy policy of the Social Network.\n\n### 2.3  Disclosure to other services, websites and companies\n\nOne of Trustpilot's main goals is to increase the exposure and availability of reviews on the Website. We therefore permit other services to show reviews created on the Website. This increases the potential audience for your reviews.\n\nThe categories of third party services and companies who can show your review(s) together with your public user profile are:\n\n- Search engines, including Google and Bing\n- Companies reviewed on Trustpilot\n- Companies that have invited you to review a Product\n- Consumer portals and business portals, including price comparison websites, shopping guides, etc.\n- Application partners and platforms, such as Prestashop, Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce  \n- Other similar websites where, in Trustpilot’s assessment, it will be relevant for users to search for reviews.\n- Facebook, if your review has been shared on the Social Network\n\nOnce you submit your review, it is published on the Website. This means that the following information is disclosed:\n\n- Your review(s), (see 1.2, above)\n- Your username, location (country) and the additional data you choose to add to your profile, such as your name, a profile description, photo, gender, city and language.\n\nIf you write a review on Trustpilot in response to an invitation sent by a company via our review invitation services, the company who sent you the invite will be able to link your review with the invitation. \n\nIf we need to verify your review, we will contact you and ask for documentation that shows that you have had a buying or service experience with the company you reviewed. We therefore recommend that you keep such documentation for 12 months from the date of your review. We explain the type of documentation you should send us [here](https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/201839083-Which-documents-help-us-verify-your-review-).\n\nWe do not share the documentation you send to us with the reviewed company. However, if you have a reference number or order ID, we may pass that on to the company, unless you ask us not to.\n\n### 2.4  Other disclosures\n\nIn addition to the above, we disclose your personal data to the following parties and in the following circumstances:\n\n- To allow third party vendors, consultants and other service providers to perform services on our behalf\n- To Trustpilot subsidiaries and other companies within the Trustpilot group of companies\n- To comply with laws or to respond to claims, legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas and court orders) and requests from public and government authorities\n- To cooperate with regulatory bodies and government authorities in connection with investigations or case referrals \n- To third parties in connection with enforcement of our [Terms \u0026 Conditions](/for-reviewers/end-user-terms-and-conditions) and [User Guidelines](/for-reviewers/guidelines-for-reviewers)\n- To third parties in order for us to protect our operations or those of our affiliates\n- To third parties to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property and/or that of our affiliates, you or others\n- To third parties in order for us to pursue available remedies, or limit damages that we may sustain\n- To third parties in order for us to investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and misuse of our Website\n- To a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, acquisition, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business or assets (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings)\n\n\n## 3.  Data controller\n\n### 3.1  Information for which we are the data controller\n\nWe are the data controller of the Master Data and other additional information you enter to create and maintain your profile, which includes but is not limited to your name, password, email address and location, as well as the registration of your IP address.\n\nWe are also the data controller of the information which is disclosed to other services (see 2.3).\n\nDenmark’s data protection laws govern collection of personal data by Trustpilot in the EU.\n\n### 3.2  Information for which you are the data controller\n\nYou are the data controller for the content you choose to disclose on the Website, and for the personal data disclosed when you connect your Social Network profile(s) with your profile on the Website.\n\n\n## 4.  Links to websites\n\nOur Website contains links to other websites. Our inclusion of such links does not imply that we endorse those websites. We do not control the content of those third party websites, and assume no responsibility for the third party or their policies or practices.\n\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies for these third party websites because their procedures for collecting, handling and processing personal data will be different from ours.\n\n\n## 5.  Data processors\n\nWe use external companies to maintain the technical operation of the Website and our services. These companies are data processors for the personal data for which we are the data controller. By accepting this Policy, you agree that we may also allow the data for which you are the data controller to be processed by these data processors.\n\nWe have data processing agreements in place with the data processors and it follows from these agreements that they must act solely in accordance with our instructions. By accepting this Policy, you authorize us to instruct the data processors to process data in accordance with the Policy and for the purposes of using the Website.\n\nThe data processors have taken reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect against the information being accidentally or illegally destroyed, becoming lost or deteriorating, and to protect against the information being disclosed to unauthorized persons, being misused, or in other ways being processed in violation of data protection laws.\n\nOn your request – and possibly in return for remuneration at the data processors' applicable hourly rates at any time for such work – the data processors must supply you with sufficient information to demonstrate that the above-mentioned technical and organizational safety measures have been taken.\n\nThe Website is controlled and operated by us from the U.S. and is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country, or territory other than that of the U.S. If you access or use the Website from a location outside of the U.S., you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal data in the U.S.\n\n\n## 6.  Data retention\n\nWe keep the Master Data and other personal data you provide, including your reviews, for as long as you have an Account or as needed to provide you with our services. If you choose to delete your Account please note that all your reviews will also be deleted. We will delete this information upon your request and we will only save a log with the following information: your name, email address and the date of the deletion of your Account. We will keep the log for 3 years. All other information will be deleted.\n\nIn some cases, even if you delete your account, we then choose to retain certain information (e.g. visits to our Website) in an anonymized or aggregated form.\n\n\n## 7.  Security measures\n\nWe use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect your personal data within our organization and we regularly audit our system for vulnerabilities. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the information you transmit to us. Emails sent via the Website may not be encrypted, and we therefore advise you not to include any confidential information in your emails to us.\n\nTo learn more about our current practices and policies regarding security and other information, please see [our security practices](https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000721308--Our-security-practices).
